This is Forge Mod Loader, a clean open source implementation of a mod loader for minecraft servers
and minecraft clients, authored by cpw.

It began by partially implementing an API defined by the client side 
[ModLoader](https://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/75440-), authored by Risugami.
This support has been dropped as of Minecraft release 1.7, as Risugami no longer maintains ModLoader.

It also contains suggestions and hints and generous helpings of code from LexManos, author of 
[MinecraftForge](https://www.minecraftforge.net/).

Additionally, it contains an implementation of topological sort based on that 
published at https://keithschwarz.com/interesting/code/?dir=topological-sort

It also contains code from the [Maven project](https://maven.apache.org/) for performing versioned dependency
resolution.

Forge Mod Loader downloads components from the [Minecraft Coder Pack](http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/Main_Page) 
with kind permission from the MCP team.

## MinecraftForge

- LexManos
- cpw
- Eloraam
- SpaceToad
- FlowerChild
- Hawkye
- MALfunction84
  - Submitted the sleep handler code for his mod (Somnia) and others to use.
- Scokeev9
  - Gave permission for ScotTools API to be integrated into MCF, and also supported the Forge 
    by converting his mods to use it.  
    ScotTools Background: ScotTools was an API that enabled modders to add blocks to harvesting levels 
    (and many other ease-of-use features to create new tools), 
    and the first tool API that used block material for block breaking efficiency which allowed blocks 
    from mods that didn't use ScotTools API to break with the correct speed.
- Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP)
  - Forge Mod Loader and Minecraft Forge have permission to distribute and automatically
    download components of MCP and distribute MCP data files. 
    This permission is not transitive and others wishing to redistribute 
    the Minecraft Forge source independently should seek permission of MCP or 
    remove the MCP data files and request their users to download MCP separately.
